# MayaScripts
Useful scripts for working with Maya

# Available scripts
## Select All Non Quad Polygons
This will try to select all polygons that are non-quad.
The script can be still improved in V2.
Once the script ran you should press CTRL+F11 to turn the selection into polygons as it is currently considerd 'objects'
If no non-quads are found everthing will become selected, this is a bit confusing and can be improved in V2.

# How to use the scripts

1) Find the script you want to use. Use either the Python or MEL version
2) Open Maya
3) Open the Script Editor (Windows -> General Editors -> Script Editor) OR the button at the bottom right of Maya
4) Click on the small + button

5) Choose Python or MEL, depending on the script you chose (I will either have both or 1 of them available)
6) Copy and Paste the code in the editor
7) Now go (File -> Save script to shelf..) and input a name
![save-script](images/save-to-shelf.png)
8) A new button should now be added to the shelf
![shelf](images/shelf.png)
9) Enjoy
